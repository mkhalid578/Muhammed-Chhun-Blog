# Muhammed-Chhun-Blog
# Project Title: Interactive OPL Blog Page

### Statement

This project allows users to post thier daily blog which allows other users to make comments and share thier thoughts on the blog. Users can upload thier photos as well as share vidoes they like from youtube or any other sites by copying URL of the site. All blogs, photos, and videos posted will be stored on a database provided if we have enough time. Personally, we think that this project is interesting because we could post daily activities as a dairy, and we think that a social media is not supposed to be just personal information and having friends added each other like Facebook or Instragram. However, a post could be from an anonymous person about a story as a general knowlegde or some activities that we barely see on the daily news, so others can hear about it. We hope from this project we could learn more not only just learning scheme, but also how to use different libraries already within the scheme language. Morever, we hope to create something for public uses as well. 

### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project. Be explicit: e.g., will you use recursion? How? Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? Will you use data abstraction? Will you use object-orientation? Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? Will you use state-modification approaches? A combination?

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project. 

### Data set or other source materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?  

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

At the end of the project, we expect to successfully implement all encoded functions in racket. Firstly, we have to make sure the creating blog function works accurately then be sure to store it into the database, then the updating posted blog function. Adding/Updating/Removing comment funciton will be afterward. Secondly, we will implement the upload photos/videos and share videos by URL function and be sure it implements the way they suppose to be. Lastly and the most important part of this software will be the implementation of the database. It is so important becuase all posted blogs will be stored in the database. Interactively, we think this software should be successfully executed for all operating system as long as it is capatible with the Dr.racket program, and we will test that part at the end of the project before the final presentation.

### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

This project will be completely successful when we implement all required functoins correctly, and it passes testing processes.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
Our first milestone will be User Interface, Creaeting/Updating a blog, and Adding/Updating/Removing comments. 

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
Our second milestone will be Uploading Photos/Videos, and Sharing videos by URL

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
Before final presentation, Implementing the database, testing the project. 

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

**Additional instructions for teams of three:** 
* Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved `FP3` team declaration submission).
* The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
* The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
* Identify who is team lead.

In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.
